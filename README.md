  <h1>Swbrain v1</h1>
  <p>Swbrain v1 is a project aimed at creating a computer-based simulation of the human brain. This is achieved through the use of advanced machine learning algorithms, mathematical models, and data processing techniques to create a virtual representation of the brain.</p>
  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>To install Swbrain v1, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. Once you have Python installed, you can install Swbrain v1 and its dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:</p>
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

  <h2>Data Preparation</h2>
  <p>Before the brain simulation can be run, the data must be preprocessed and prepared. This can be done using the <code>data_preparation.ipynb</code> notebook, which contains the necessary code for loading, filtering, segmenting, and feature extraction on the EEG signal data.</p>
  <h2>Model Training</h2>
  <p>Once the data has been prepared, the next step is to train the machine learning models. This can be done using the <code>model_training.ipynb</code> notebook, which contains the necessary code for training both neural network and hidden Markov models on the preprocessed data.</p>
  <h2>Brain Simulation</h2>
  <p>Finally, once the models have been trained, the brain simulation can be run using the <code>brain_simulation.py</code> script. This script takes the preprocessed data and trained models as inputs, and outputs the results of the brain simulation, including classification accuracy and predicted brain state.</p>
  <h2>Directory Structure</h2>
  <p>The directory structure of Swbrain v1 is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
